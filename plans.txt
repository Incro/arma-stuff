Capture Altis is a coop(maybe player version later) map where you can capture every city on Altis until you 
completely captured
Altis.

Ideas:
- players on west side
- EAST is AI controlled
- every city does have trigger, area marker and flag that change depending on who is in controll.
- AI and player respawn at military base.
- military bases will inherit spawn point and vehicles depending on size and type
(HQ,FOB,Outpost, Naval Outpost etc), see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_base for suggestions.


AI:
- AI should split up there army in an intelegent way:
*there should be more AI at the frontline and coast, villages and cities far away from frontline 
should have less to no AI in it.
* squads should be based on military base.
* ai should reeinforce if a city or base is attacked(priority of cities)
* reeinforcements come in by helo, vehicle or on foot depending on distance and vehicles available.
- a few ai units should be special forces with a higher skill level (and some different infil
 methods like parachute and stuff)


Vehicles:
- there should be vehicles all over the map
- military vehicles will spawn at military base
	* type and amount of vehicles should depend on size of the military base(FOB, HQ, Outpost)
